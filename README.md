# Simple-HR-chatbot-using-Langchain
A simple chatbot that answers questions about Spanish labor laws, specificallly the "Estatuto de los Trabajadores" and the "Convenio de la Publicidad". It gets answers directly from these legal texts that are public and accesible to everyone and responds in Spanish or English.

This project is mainly about learning. I'm still a begginer and I had this idea after attending a seminar on Generative AI.

I work in HR, and I’m really familiar with the Convenio de la Publicidad (the collective agreement for advertising companies in Spain). I get a lot of questions at work that are actually answered in the agreement itself. So I thought it would be a good idea to combine my work experience with my curiosity about AI and build something useful.

Also, since I already know the answers to most of these questions, it’s a great way to check if the chatbot is doing its job correctly.

**Don't use this chatbot as your legal counselor, always double check with your HRBP or your lawyer. As I said, I'm a begginer so this chatbot can make mistakes.

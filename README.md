# Simple-HR-chatbot-using-Langchain
A simple chatbot that answers questions about Spanish labor laws, specificallly the "Estatuto de los Trabajadores" and the "Convenio de la Publicidad". It gets answers directly from these legal texts that are public and accesible to everyone and responds in Spanish or English.

I work in HR, and Iâ€™m really familiar with the Convenio de la Publicidad (the collective agreement for advertising companies in Spain). I get a lot of questions at work that are actually answered in the agreement itself. So I thought it would be a good idea to combine my work experience with my curiosity about AI and build something useful, but of course the main and only goal of this project is to learn and improve my skills. I think it goes without saying but:


**Don't use this chatbot as your legal advisor, always check with your HRBP or your lawyer. As I said, I'm a begginer so this chatbot can make mistakes.
